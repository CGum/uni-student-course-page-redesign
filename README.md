This project was done to redesign the add/drop courses page of the UNBC website. Some of the code itself contains information about UNBC courses which is not available publicly so I will be removing those pieces from my code, which makes the website not function like it should. I will still put rest of the code on here for viewing though. 

By downloading everything you will still be able to see how the website looks. Again the add/remove buttons will not function because I took out the information related to UNBC classes.

The current style is very oldschool and lacks many useful functionalities. It is a pain to navigate through and this project fixes all the issues it has. 

The following image shows what we are working with currently

I have deleted some information for privacy purposes but the highlighted areas in different colors throw a lot of unnecessary and unavoidable information in the users face. 

When I run the code with all files and data included the following is what it looks like.

The downloadable HTML I have on here will not have the functionality to add and remove courses because of the missing information I will take out of my code.

The following image shows the redesigned version of the course add√©drop page.

Each class is an expandable section where once clicked on will reveal all the information about it including the main class, labs and tutorials if there are any. Once the user clicks on a select radio button, the weekly schedule updates in real time.
